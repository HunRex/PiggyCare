  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Montserrat
      fonts:
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Montserrat-Regular.ttf
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Montserrat-Bold.ttf
        - asset: lib/assets/fonts/Montserrat-ExtraBold.ttf
          #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.io/custom-fonts/#from-packages
